# Helvecities
**Rebuild swiss medieval cities**

A 2D video game made with Godot.

This repository contains the prototype of the game. It's not really playable, but you can discover the main guidelines of the future game.

The only created level concerns the urban evolution of Lausanne in the Middle Age between 8th and 16th centuries.

## Goals of the prototype

- Use historical knowledge, build with the preparation of the guided tour [Les invisibles du quotidien](https://2022.histoire-cite.ch/programme/sur-les-traces-des-habitants-de-la-lausanne-medievale/) in the *Festival Histoire et Cité*
- Test the game mechanics
- Learn Godot

## Context

Helvecities v.0 was created in Summer 2022 by Loïc Aubrays for the exam *Projet en informatique pour les sciences humaines* in Master degree at [Faculté des Lettres, Université de Lausanne](https://unil.ch/lettres).

Helvecities is his first game with Godot and the second after [Cooking for the King](https://github.com/Aubrays/cooking-for-the-king/), made with Phaser.
